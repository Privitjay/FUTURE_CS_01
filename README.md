## 6. Detailed Vulnerabilities

#### 6.1.1  Nikto

I used Nikto to scan for vulnerabilities on the webpage.. 
Nikto found a login.php databases and config files.

### 6.2 üõ†Ô∏èüîì Brute Force Login Page

- **Module:** Brute Force  
- **Level:** Low-Impossible
- **Payload:** Dictionary Attack
- **Result:** Login Page accessed  
- **Mitigation:** Use stronger Password and implement strong password policies

#### 6.2.1 Hydra

i used hydra a bruteforcing tool to carry out a dictionary attack on the login.php to test for weak credentials if possible.

![Alt text](./images/Hydra.PNG)

weak creds were found via my dictionary attack and i gained access to the webpage via the login form.

### 6.3 üß® Command Injection

on the cloud i inputed commands like: 


```bash
google.com | pwd && whoami 
```
```bash
google.com | cat /etc/passwd
```
in similar fashion i accessed the systeminfo when i installed the DVWA on XAMP windows machine 

```bash
google.com | dir && systeminfo
```

### 6.4 üß® SQL Injection

```bash
first i tested the login page for a potential sql error with just closing the  syntax | ' and this created the error seen below and this let me know there was an error shown and a possilbe potential for a code injection
```

![Alt text](./images/image.png)

```bash
In easy mode i ran ( 1' OR '1'='1)
```
![Alt text](./images/sqleasy.png)



i found the number of existing columns by just inputing numbers 1 and i saw the two colums name and surname but one can also find this by inputing ' ORDER BY 1 and change numbers until failure, and that tells how manys columns are there.

| File Handling     | Restrict file types, validate MIME types         |
| Authentication    | Implement rate limiting, strong password rules   |
| CSRF Protection   | Use CSRF tokens with same-site cookie flags      |
| Logging & Alerts  | Monitor unusual activity                         |



## 10. Conclusion

DVWA successfully demonstrated the impact of common web application vulnerabilities under various security levels. The hands-on testing reinforces best practices in secure coding, vulnerability mitigation, and the need for continuous security assessments in real-world applications.
